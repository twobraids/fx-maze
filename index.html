        <h1>Solve the Firefox Maze</h1>
        <p>A couple times per year, we gather together somewhere on planet to talk, plan and support our mission. </p>
        <p>It's a long flight to the December 2016 goal of the Big Island of Hawaii. We need a way to pass the time as we travel. </p>
        <p>In 2015 on the way to Orlando Florida, <a href="http://twobraids.com">K Lars Lohn</a> offered a maze in the
          shape of the Firefox logo. As an image on a screen, however, there was no easy way to solve it.  This year,
          in cahoots with <a href="http://lmorchard.com">Les Orchard</a>, it's a Web app.</p>
      </div>
      <p id="buttons"><span id="theStartButton">START NEW GAME</span><span id="countdown"> </span><span id="theResumeButton">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESUME THE GAME</span></p>
      <div class="howto boxed extra-to-hide">
        <p id="warning">Android & iOS users - start the game with this page scrolled to the top - see <a href="#knownissues">known issues</a> below</p>
        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <p>The objective is to move your player from the maze start point through to the end. Once at the end,
        you've made it to Hawaii.</p>
        <h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
        <p>As you move through the maze, you'll notice numbers appear each time you get to a branch in the path. These
        are breadcrumbs.  Just pass them by. If you get to a dead end, you can jump backwards through the numbers,
        until you figure out where you went wrong.  To see how to jump back, see the method below that corresponds how
        you are playing the game.</p>
        <h2>Clues</h2>
        <p>This maze is huge and could take days to solve, so your cursor can give you clues.  Watch its color.
        When you stray from the correct path, your cursor will slowly turn pink.  If it completely
        turns red, you've been off the path for a long time.  Either reverse course until the cursor turns white again,
        or use the breadcrumbs feature to leap back to a previous decision point.</p>
        <h2>Zoom</h2>
          <p>There are two viewing modes: manual and auto zoom. The game starts in manual mode where you control the
          level of the zoom yourself.  See the method outlined below.  Auto zoom controls the zoom for you: zoomed in
          when your cursor is moving; zoomed out when not moving.</p>
        <div class="methods-section extra-to-hide">
          <div class="method extra-to-hide"><h2>On a phone or touch tablet</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="listItem">single finger touch</span>: The game cursor is attracted to location of a single
                finger touch. You're not dragging the game cursor, but more like coaxing it.  The game cursor will
                try to move toward your finger, but it is constrained by the walls of the maze.  You're
                leading it in the direction that you want it to go.  Some people report that using a stylus makes movement
                easier.</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">double finger tap</span>: move back through the numbered breadcrumbs.  Each tap is one leap.</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">triple finger tap</span>: toggle between Manual Zoom and Automatic Zoom</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">pinch to zoom</span>: when in Manual Zoom mode, the standard pinch to zoom method will move your perspective in
                and out</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">two finger swipe left</span>: jump back to this screen, where you may resume or start over</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="method extra-to-hide"><h2>With a Game Controller</h2>
            <p>Game controllers vary in their layout and functionality, you may have to experiment with you're to get
              to know the mapping of the buttons</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="listItem">arrow buttons</span>: these will move the game cursor in the direction indicated</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">joy stick</span>: this is another way to move the game cursor</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">blue button / X button</span>: move back through the numbered breadcrumbs</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">yellow button / Y button</span>: toggle between Manual Zoom and Automatic Zoom</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">green button / A button</span>: when in Manual Zoom mode, this button zooms the view closer</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">red button / B button</span>: when in Manual Zoom mode, this button zoom the view outward</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">back button</span>: return to this screen, where you may resume or start over</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="method extra-to-hide"><h2>With a Mouse</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="listItem">left button</span>: the game cursor is attracted to the mouse cursor when the
                left button is clicked. You're not dragging the cursor around, you're coaxing it. The game cursor will try to move toward your mouse
                cursor, but the game cursor is constrained by the maze pathways.  You lead the game cursor with your mouse
                cursor.  The distance between the game cursor and the mouse cursor is directly proportional to the speed
                that the game cursor moves: closer is slower, farther is faster.</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">right button</span>: this is the mouse method of moving back through the numbered breadcrumbs. Each click is
                a jump back.</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">scroll wheel</span>: when in manual zoom mode, scrolling the mouse wheel zoom in and out.</li>
              <li><span class="listItem">middle button</span>: pressing the middle mouse button (usually the scroll wheel itself) toggles between
                the Manual Zoom and Automatic Zoom</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="method extra-to-hide"><h2>With a Keyboard</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="listItem">arrow keys</span>: will move the cursor in the indicated direction. They can be use in combination</li>
            <li><span class="listItem">WASD</span>: these letter keys in an inverted-T shape work like the arrow keys</li>
            <li><span class="listItem">backspace</span>: each press of this key will jump you back to latest breadcrumb decision point</li>
            <li><span class="listItem">=/+</span>: this key (without regard to shift state) will zoom the display in closer</li>
            <li><span class="listItem">-</span>: this key will zoom outward for a higher level view</li>
            <li><span class="listItem">Z</span>: this toggles between the Manual Zoom and Auto Zoom modes</li>
            <li><span class="listItem">P</span>: jump back to this screen, where you may resume or start over</li>
          </ul>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="listItem">Firefox for Android</span>: poor performance on some devices.</li>
          <li><span class="listItem">Firefox for Android & iOS</span>: if the game is started when the original page is
            scrolled, the tab bar may reflexively strobe up and down through game play. <strong>Get around this</strong> by using a <em>two
              finger left swipe</em> to pause the game, ensure the page is scrolled to the top, then hit the "Resume" button.</li>
          <li><span class="listItem">Firefox for Android & iOS</span>: if the game is started with the original page zoomed in, the
            game play resolution may be very pixelated or reduced to only a part of the screen. There is currently no work-around. Restart the game without zooming in the
            original page text.</li>
